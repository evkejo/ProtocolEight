# ProtocolEight
Firewalls protect networks. Antivirus protects computers. ProtocolEight protects people - because that's what scammers actually attack.

**Instant email alerts when your family downloads remote access software**  
**Detects TeamViewer, AnyDesk, and other tools used by scammers**  
**Emergency removal scripts to stop scams in progress**  
**100% free, always - no barriers to family protection**

## The Problem

Traditional security protects Layers 1-7 of the network stack. But scammers attack **Layer 8 - the human layer**. They don't hack computers; they trick people into installing remote access software and handing over control.

**This happens thousands of times daily to elderly parents, non-tech-savvy relatives, and anyone who trusts the wrong phone call.**

## The Solution

ProtocolEight Layer 8 Protection allows you to monitor your family's computers. You don't have to be a SOC Analyst, Cyber Security Engineer, or even know what Powershell is. ProtocolEight will set up a local script on whatever computer you choose, and, using local data (i.e. we don't collect anything) **instantly email you** when suspicious software is installed or threats are detected.

### Quick Start (30 seconds)
